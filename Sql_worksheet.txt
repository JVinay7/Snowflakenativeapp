'What is NPS, and how does it measure customer loyalty?',
'
**Net Promoter Score (NPS)** measures how likely your customers are to recommend your business to others. Customers are asked:
*How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?*
 
- **Promoters** (Score 9-10): Very happy customers who will likely recommend your business.
- **Passives** (Score 7-8): Satisfied but not overly enthusiastic customers.
- **Detractors** (Score 0-6): Unhappy customers who may speak negatively about your business.
 
 
NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. The higher the score, the better your customer loyalty.

'
Customer AI divides customers into four segments based on their buying habits and engagement:
 
- **Uninfluenced and At-Risk**: These customers don’t buy often or show much interest.
- **Leading Edgers**: These are highly engaged customers who like to try new products first.
- **Genuine and Loyal**: These customers buy regularly and are very loyal.
- **Consciously Engaged**: These customers are actively engaged and care about the values behind their purchases, like social or environmental causes.
 
 
This segmentation helps businesses tailor their marketing and service to different customer groups.
